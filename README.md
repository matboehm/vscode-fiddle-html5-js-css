# VS Code Fiddle with HTML5 + Vanilla JS + CSS

VS Code Fiddle with HTML5 + Vanilla JS + CSS is a small boilerplate for rapid prototyping for webdevelopment.

It relies on the [VS Code LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), or any other server able to serve the static files.

## Installation

Use git clone to clone this repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone matthib/vscode-fiddle-html5-js-css
```

Be sure to also have the extension [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code installed.

## Usage

To start hacking just open VS Code with this project folder.

If you are cool you use the console:
```bash
code .
```
Then just start the Live Server extension (right click ojn index.html file > Open with live server).

This will start the webserver at [http://localhost:5500//](http://localhost:5500/) and render the HTML code. Any changes you make should be automatically detected and the website reloaded.
